    <h3>Pokémon Emerald</h3>
    <p> 
        Ironically the first Pokémon game I played was a third generation game and it was Pokémon Emerald. 
        I played it on a gameboy emulator on my cell phone called “MyGBA”, and it is, without a doubt my favorite 
        Pokémon game. I've played it at least 5 times, although I'll always remember the first time I played it, 
        I've always liked Pokémon and the third generation introduced interesting mechanics for the time, such as 
        natures, abilities and so on.

    <h3>Pokémon Fire Red</h3>
    <p>
        My second Pokémon game to which I also put many hours was Pokémon Fire Red, the second 
        generation remake of one of the first Pokémon games (Red). This was also in an emulator, 
        which is called RetroArch and in this case in my laptop, since I don't have any GameBoy Advance. 
        I still had a lot of fun with this game, besides playing it with my favorite pokemon of the 
        first generation.

    <h3>Pokémon Platinum</h3>
    <p>
        The third Pokémon game I played was Pokemon Platinum, a fourth generation game, and the 
        truth is that I would say it's my favorite Pokémon game, but Pokémon Emerald I've played for 
        longer and I've grown more fond of it, although being a third generation game it doesn't have 
        separation of moves with its types, not like in the fourth generation games, which have special 
        and physical type moves, regardless of the type. I also captured Giratina and Dialga, and two of 
        the three legendaries of the lake. It also has my favorite initial (Torterra), and the trio of favorite 
        initials, plus there is also Drifblim, one of my favorite Pokémon.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        I've always liked Pokémon, I have a lot of Pokémon cards, some of them worth more than 15 CAD, 
        plus several stuffed animals, including my Duskull plush (the Pokémon in the picture) which is one 
        of my favorites, plus I also have a Magikarp plush, a Charmeleon plush and a Pikachu keychain. 
        I've always liked Pokémon, and even though I haven't bought any game so far, I've always liked its 
        games, its mechanics, its community and even the anime. I have also played Pokémon MMO, and 
        Pokémon Showdonw, a game 100% focused on competitive.
